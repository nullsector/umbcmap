Project Overview

The program is an Android application that organizes information about UMBCâ€™s campus and locations on campus in a searchable form. The information will be displayed on a map of the campus. The information about the campus is organized and searchable. A user is able to select which categories of information they want to see displayed on the map or search each specific category for a particular location. For example, a student looking for which building has their lecture hall should be able to search only lecture halls where as a student looking for food on campus should be able to search specifically for food locations.
